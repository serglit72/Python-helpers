# Python-helpers
Some helpers for my productivity
### ip.py
The script is created for IP address verification on two ENV (prod/stage)
To use it just dowload the file into Desktop and use the CLI (Terminal) like this way:

```bash
 $ python ip.py 123.45.67.89
```
  - IP address is argument for the function
  It's much faster if you set up an alias for Terminal (MacOS) like:
  ```bash
  $ alias ip?='python ip.py'
  ```
  than you can use:
  ```
  $ ip? 123.45.67.89
 ```
### you_tube_watcher.py
The script helps to check if the YouTube channel is updated 1 time per run OR every day(needs to enchance)
### my_sql_connector.py
The script for test connection to mySQL DB and check availability of data
